# TVT23SPL_R8_Weather_station
# Electronics Application Project

The electronics application project is part of the second-year studies in the Bachelor’s Degree in Information and Communication Technology. It serves as the final project for the second year and has been designed to challenge students and their skills by requiring them to build a device of their own choosing, which includes an analog interface and a microcontroller.

## Project Goal
The main goals of the project were:

•	To design and build a functional PCB

•	To build a functional and portable weather station around the PCB, equipped with sensors for wind speed, humidity, air pressure, and temperature

•	To transmit the sensor values via Bluetooth to a computer, and via wires to an OLED display

•	To integrate the weather station into a hat

## Learning Experiences and Challenges

During the project, we gained extensive experience in device-oriented design and programming. Especially the circuit design and implementation provided both learning opportunities and challenges. The most difficult part turned out to be getting the entire system to work together.
Challenges included:
•	Designing the PCB to be just right for our use
•	Getting the optical fork (opto-interrupter) to work with the ESP32
•	Displaying data correctly on the OLED display
•	Fitting all project components into a hat

## Summary

The electronics application project was a challenging experience in terms of skills and learning, and it was the most demanding part of the academic year. However, it was extremely educational and valuable for our future careers. The goal of our project was to build a functional, head-worn weather station that displays wind speed, humidity, and temperature in real time to the user. We believe we succeeded in the project, as we met the goals we had set for ourselves, and the project was a success.
